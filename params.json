{"name":"HackerYou Rails VM","tagline":"Setting up your virtual machine!","body":"### Welcome to the HackerYou Summer Academy!\r\nIn order to ensure everyone has the right command line tools and programs, we'll all be developing on a Virtual Machine, or VM. The VM is custom to the HackerYou environment and includes Ruby 2.0, Rails 4.0, git, mysql, and some other nice things. You're going to use a tool called Vagrant to run your VM invisibly inside your main operating system. This means you can use your operating system's native programs (like a text editor and web browser) to work on things, but they'll all be run from a command line that is secretly UNIX.\r\n\r\nThat's a lot of words. Don't worry, it's super simple to set up:\r\n\r\n### 1. Install VirtualBox\r\n\r\nVirtualBox is the actual software that will invisibly run our virtual machines. Simply download it and run the installer.\r\n\r\n- Windows: [download](http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/4.2.14/VirtualBox-4.2.14-86644-Win.exe)\r\n- Mac: [download](http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/4.2.10/VirtualBox-4.2.10-84104-OSX.dmg)\r\n\r\n### 2. Install Vagrant\r\n\r\nVagrant is the software that manages your virtual machine on your local computer, and makes it easy to run commands in the VM. It's also super simple to set up; just download it and, again, run the installer.\r\n\r\n[Download](http://downloads.vagrantup.com/tags/v1.2.2)\r\n\r\n### 3. Download the HackerYou Vagrantfile\r\n\r\nThe Vagrantfile is something we've configured with all of the software you'll need in the VM. \r\n\r\n- Click the giant **Download .ZIP** button at the top of the page.\r\n- Unzip the downloaded file on your computer.\r\n  - Windows: Double click the file, and press the **Extract All** toolbar button.\r\n  - Mac: Will either happen automatically, or just double click the file.\r\n- Rename the newly created and unzipped directory to `hacker_you`. This will become your main working directory where you'll keep all of your projects!\r\n- Move the new `hacker_you` directory into your home folder, so it's easy to get to.\r\n  - Windows: `C:/Users/ME`\r\n  - Mac: The default folder that opens when you open a Finder window, aka `/Users/ME`.\r\n\r\n### 4. Run `vagrant up`\r\n\r\n- Open a command prompt.\r\n  - Windows: Press **Start**, type `cmd`, and then press Enter.\r\n  - Mac: Open **Applications/Utilities/Terminal**\r\n- Type `cd hacker_you` and press Enter. (You'll understand what this does in just a minute!)\r\n- Type `vagrant up`.\r\n\r\nThis could take quite a while, so while it's working, you should get started watching [Intro to Command Line](https://peepcode.com/products/meet-the-command-line)!\r\n\r\n### 5. Jump into your new VM!\r\n\r\nYour virtual machine is now running invisibly in the background. Whenever you want to start working with it (for example, to follow along with the video above or to start working on a project), you'll want to follow very similar steps:\r\n\r\n- Open a command prompt.\r\n- Type `cd hacker_you` and press Enter.\r\n- Type `vagrant ssh`.\r\n\r\nAfter you type `vagrant ssh`, you'll see that the command prompt changes to signify that you're running inside the Vagrant VM. You can now safely practice all of the commands you're learning in the screencast or type `rails new my_app` to start a new Rails app!\r\n\r\n### What now?\r\n\r\nFinish up with the video, and start playing around in your new VM. If you're feeling a bit lost about the command line, don't worry, we'll review it a little bit in class. If you have trouble getting the VM working, don't hesitate to ask a mentor!","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
